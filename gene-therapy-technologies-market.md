<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy Technologies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy technologies are categorized into two main market types: Type I and Type II. Type I focuses on in vivo approaches, where therapeutic genes are delivered directly into the patient’s body, typically using viral vectors. This method aims to treat diseases by modifying cells within the body. Type II, on the other hand, involves ex vivo therapies, where cells are extracted, genetically modified outside the body, and then reintroduced to the patient. This approach is often used for treating inherited disorders and certain cancers.</p></p>
