<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Casing Hangers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Slip-type</li><li>Core Shaft Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The casing hangers market consists of two primary types: slip-type and core shaft type. Slip-type casing hangers feature a series of slips that grip the casing, providing secure support when lowered into a well. They enable efficient weight distribution and easy installation. Core shaft type hangers, on the other hand, utilize a centralized shaft that supports the casing's weight, offering stability and facilitating the handling of larger casings. Both types are essential for ensuring the structural integrity of wells during drilling and production operations.</p></p>
