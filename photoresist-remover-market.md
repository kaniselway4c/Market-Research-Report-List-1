<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Remover Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Type</li><li>Negative Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist remover market is primarily categorized into two types: positive and negative photoresist removers. Positive photoresists undergo polymerization upon exposure to light, making the exposed areas soluble during development, while negative photoresists harden upon exposure, rendering the unexposed areas soluble. Consequently, positive photoresist removers target the residual polymerized material for removal, whereas negative types focus on dissolving the unexposed sections. Both types play crucial roles in semiconductor fabrication, microelectronics, and other applications requiring precise patterning and etching.</p></p>
